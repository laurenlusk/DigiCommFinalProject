There are two main files:

    svd_example.m
    svd_with_filt.m

Use svd_example.m to run the experiment presented in Sec. III-B of the paper.
Use svd_with_filt.m to run the code presented in Sec. III-C of the paper.

Figures generated using svd_with_filt.m are saved in SVD_with_FFT/figures.

Singular Value Powerpoints have plots of the all of the singular values generated for each snipped using svd_with_filt.m.
